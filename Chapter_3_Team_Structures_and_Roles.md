# Chapter 3  
## Team Structures & Roles  
### The Architecture of Collaboration  

The second layer (People, Skills & Talent) gives you capable individuals.  
But capability alone doesn’t create performance — **coordination does.**

This layer is where an organization truly begins to function as a system:  
it’s about how people connect, communicate, and collaborate to produce results.

---

### 🔹 What This Layer Is  

**Team Structures & Roles** define how people come together to create value.  
It’s the blueprint for accountability, communication, and decision-making.  

Structure answers questions like:  
- Who works with whom?  
- Who decides what?  
- How does information flow?  
- How are responsibilities divided and integrated?

The clarity of structure determines the **speed and quality** of execution.

---

### 🔹 Why It Matters  

Even the most talented team fails when roles are unclear.  
When people don’t know what’s expected or where authority lies, progress slows down.  

Structure doesn’t just prevent chaos — it **enables focus.**  
When done right, it removes friction, empowers autonomy, and builds accountability.

Without clear structure:
- Leadership drowns in micromanagement.  
- Teams duplicate work or miss critical gaps.  
- Individuals burn energy navigating confusion instead of creating value.

### 🔹 Common Dysfunctions  

#### 1. **Role Ambiguity**  
- Nobody knows who owns what.  
- Tasks fall through the cracks or get duplicated.  
**Fix:** Define ownership explicitly. Write it down. Use RACI or DACI frameworks for recurring decisions.  

---

#### 2. **Overlapping Teams**  
- Two teams with similar mandates compete for the same outcomes.  
- Collaboration becomes turf warfare.  
**Fix:** Design for clarity of purpose — align teams to value streams or customer outcomes.  

---

#### 3. **Decision Paralysis**  
- Everyone needs to be consulted; no one can decide.  
- Momentum dies in endless meetings.  
**Fix:** Push decisions as low as possible. Empower the people closest to the work.  

---

#### 4. **Broken Communication Chains**  
- Information gets stuck in silos.  
- Teams make decisions with partial context.  
**Fix:** Establish open communication systems and rituals — clear documentation, asynchronous updates, regular syncs.  

---

#### 5. **Overloaded Managers**  
- One leader oversees too many people or functions.  
- Coaching and direction suffer.  
**Fix:** Keep spans of control manageable (ideally 5–8 direct reports). Build leadership capacity as the org scales.  

---

### 🔹 How to Strengthen This Layer  

#### 1. **Clarify Purpose Per Team**  
Each team should have a *clear mission statement* and definition of success.  
Ambiguity at the top creates chaos at the bottom.

#### 2. **Design for Flow, Not Control**  
Structure should accelerate information flow, not restrict it.  
Use fewer layers, clearer ownership, and cross-functional collaboration.

#### 3. **Codify Roles**  
Write down what each role does, where it overlaps, and where it doesn’t.  
Clarity is kind; ambiguity is cruel.

#### 4. **Build Teams Around Value, Not Function**  
Group people by the value they create for customers, not just by their titles or disciplines.

#### 5. **Revisit Regularly**  
Structure is not static — it evolves with scale. Review your org design every 6–12 months.

### 🔹 Signs of a Strong Team Structure  

- Workflows are fast and predictable.  
- Decision rights are clear at every level.  
- Communication feels natural and open.  
- Teams understand how their work connects to others.  
- Leadership spends more time enabling than firefighting.  

---

### 🔹 The Management Principle  

> “Clarity enables speed. Ambiguity guarantees friction.”  

Well-designed structures don’t slow organizations down — they free them to move faster, with less confusion and more alignment.

---

### 🔹 In Practice  

Ask yourself:
- Does every team know its purpose and primary customer?  
- Are accountabilities written down or implied?  
- Where do decisions currently get stuck?  
- How often do we review and redesign team boundaries?  

The answers reveal the health of your structural foundation.

### 🔹 Closing Thought  

Structure is the *bridge* between people and process.  
It’s the translation layer where individual brilliance becomes collective performance.

Next, we move to the fourth layer: **Processes & Systems** — where structure transforms into predictable, scalable execution.
